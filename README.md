# Data Challenges

These are data challenges that I'm working on, some of which were "assigned" by others, and some of which I made up for myself. Essentially, this is just an excuse for me to continue to learn, practice, and apply machine learning techniques that I've learned about since Insight. 

## Insight Data Challenge - Breast Cancer
This was assigned by Insight program directors to be completed within a 4-hour time period. The goal of this project was to create a model that predicts breast cancer using variables that represent different cell properties. 

## Retail: Data Mining
This is currently a work in progress. I acquired this data set of purchase history online. 

## Video Games: Predict Success of Video Games
(Currently a work in progress.) This assignment came from Insight program directors. 

## Yelp Data: Predict Restaurant Closings
(Work in progress.) The goal of this project was to predict which restaurants would close. Insights about what factors predict restaurants closing could be used to identify restaurants who might be at risk for failing - this tool could then be used to inform the owner of the restaurant that they are at risk and make recommendations for things they could do to improve their chances of staying in business.  
**Data:** I obtained this dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset/home).
