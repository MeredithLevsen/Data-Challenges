# Data Challenges

These are data challenges that I'm working on, some of which were "assigned" by others, and some of which I made up for myself. Essentially, this is just an excuse for me to continue to learn and apply machine learning techniques that I've learned about since Insight. 

## Insight Data Challenge - Breast Cancer
This was assigned by Insight program directors to be completed within a 4-hour time period. The goal of this project was to create a model that predicts breast cancer using variables that represent different cell properties. 

## Retail: Data Mining
This is currently a work in progress. I acquired this data set of purchase history online.
